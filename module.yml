# Similar to a plugin.yml, modules load from a module.yml and require certain things.
# Your module must define a 'main' String pointing to the main class, which
# 	MUST extend Module or children thereof.
# The module must also define a name to be referenced by a Game object.

main: me.capit.clustersample.SampleModule
name: SampleModule
